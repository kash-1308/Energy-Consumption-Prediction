# Energy-Consumption-Prediction

In my energy consumption prediction analysis project, Python played a critical role in managing data, developing predictive models, and analyzing the results. I applied Python to streamline the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to prediction, leveraging its powerful libraries for machine learning and data science.

# Key Features
1.) Used Pandas to load and clean the dataset, handling missing values and normalizing data to improve model performance.
2.)Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends, correlations, and seasonal variations in the energy consumption data.
3.)Used Scikit-learn to build several machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
4.)Visualized the modelâ€™s predictions vs actual energy consumption using line plots, demonstrating the accuracy of the prediction.
