# Energy-Consumption-Prediction

In my energy consumption prediction analysis project, Python played a critical role in managing data, developing predictive models, and analyzing the results. I applied Python to streamline the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to prediction, leveraging its powerful libraries for machine learning and data science.

# Key Features
i) Used Pandas to load and clean the dataset, handling missing values and normalizing data to improve model performance.
<br>
ii) Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends, correlations, and seasonal variations in the energy consumption data.
<br>
iii.) Used Scikit-learn to build several machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
<br>
iv.) Visualized the modelâ€™s predictions vs actual energy consumption using line plots, demonstrating the accuracy of the prediction.
